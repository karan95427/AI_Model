# AI Voice Assistant

An AI-powered virtual assistant built with Python that supports speech recognition, text-to-speech, Google Search automation, and AI-generated responses using Google Gemini (Gemini-1.5 Pro).

## Features
- **Voice Command Recognition**: Uses `speech_recognition` to process user voice input.
- **Text-to-Speech (TTS)**: Converts AI responses to speech using `win32com.client`.
- **AI-Powered Responses**: Integrates Google Gemini (Gemini-1.5 Pro) for generating AI responses.
- **Google Search Automation**: Opens web searches based on user queries.
- **Time Query Functionality**: Retrieves and announces the current time.
- **Music Playback**: Opens and plays a music file.
- **Chat History Management**: Resets or stores conversation history.
- **Error Handling**: Manages speech recognition and API response errors.

## Installation
### Prerequisites
Ensure you have Python 3.x installed along with the following dependencies:

```sh
pip install speechrecognition pywin32 google-generativeai
```

### Setup
1. Clone this repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ai-assistant.git
   cd ai-assistant
   ```
2. Set up the **Google Gemini API Key**:
   - Obtain an API key from [Google AI](https://ai.google.com/)
   - Create a `config.py` file and add:
     ```python
     API_KEY = "your_google_gemini_api_key"
     ```
3. Run the AI assistant:
   ```sh
   python main.py
   ```

## Usage
